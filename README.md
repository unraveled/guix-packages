# Guix packages

**Experimental** Guix packages

Most of the package definitions are based on the binary-build-system
and are not build from source.

I intend to update packages to be built from source and contribute
them upstream, but until then they can be used from this channel.

## Packages

- antelope-cdt (eosio-cdt)
- leap (nodeos)
- babashka (binary)
- solana (binary)
- kubectl (binary)
- k9s (binary)
- terraform (binary)
